The Augusto Method: A new educational and philosophical technique based on sustained contradiction-holding to drive the emergence of new symbols and meanings.
The Augusto Method

“Hold the contradiction until the new world appears.”

What is the Augusto Method?

The Augusto Method is a new educational and philosophical dialogue technique that extends the Socratic Method by deliberately seeking contradictions in thought and holding them dynamically.

Rather than resolving contradictions quickly, the Augusto Method invites participants to sustain the tension between opposing ideas,
allowing new symbols, meanings, and structures to emerge naturally from the unresolved dynamic.

Key Principles
	•	Digging: Question deeply to find contradictions beneath surface beliefs.
	•	Holding: Sustain the contradiction rather than rushing to resolve it.
	•	Emergence: Allow new meanings or frameworks to arise naturally from the tension.
	•	Mapping: Track the shifts and symbols that emerge during the process.

Dispel false beliefs
Birth new symbols and thought structures

Applications
	•	Education: Train students to handle ambiguity, complexity, and cognitive emergence.
	•	AI Research: Develop artificial systems that seek and hold contradictions to self-organize new symbols.
	•	Philosophy: Explore paradoxes as engines of conceptual innovation.

Motto

“Hold the contradiction until the new world appears.”
