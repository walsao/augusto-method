🧠 First Augusto Method Practice

1. Setup
	•	Find a partner, or do it alone by journaling.
	•	Pick a big question or belief you hold.
(Examples: “What is freedom?”, “Is technology good or bad?”, “What does it mean to understand something?”)

⸻

2. Digging
	•	Start questioning the belief, idea, or statement.
	•	Ask yourself (or your partner):
	•	“Why is this true?”
	•	“When is it not true?”
	•	“Is there an exception?”
	•	“Can both the belief and its opposite be true in some sense?”

✅ The goal is to dig until you uncover a contradiction.

⸻

3. Holding
	•	STOP.
	•	Don’t try to fix it.
	•	Don’t resolve it.
	•	Hold the contradiction.

Ask:
	•	“What does it feel like to hold both sides?”
	•	“Can something new be born from this tension?”
	•	“What if I lived with both truths at once?”

✅ Sit in the tension without fear.

⸻

4. Emergence
	•	Notice if a new idea, new symbol, new category, or new understanding naturally emerges.

✅ It might come as a metaphor, a new word, a strange connection, or even just a new feeling.

✅ Welcome it.
✅ Let it reshape your view.
